# TODOS
- [x] When there are more than one video and poster, deleting a video causes "Error loading thumbnail from OPFS:  TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'src')" at index.js:958:32
- [x] Check video playback support before uploading to OPFS or first stream a chunk of video to OPFS and then check video support from OPFS.
- [x] Decide what to do if there are more than the already uploaded video count for a profile when decreasing video count size (e.g. from 4 videos to 2 videos).
- [ ] Add video player settings support (e.g. player controls visibility).
- [x] Warn the user if there are already videos in the profile when deleting the profile.
- [x] Finish adding seperate poster functionality for a video.
- [x] Change style for the video and poster upload rows for aesthetics.
- [ ] PWA (installable, full screen, offline functionality etc.)
- [x] Make video title editable by the user
- [x] Show an indicator while a video is uploading to OPFS
- [x] There is a problem when uploading more than one video simultaneously. For example when a video is large it takes some time to upload it and I try to upload another video. This causes a problem. Look into it. -- Added some code. Seems ok for now.
